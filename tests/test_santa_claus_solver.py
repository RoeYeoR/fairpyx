Test module for the Santa Claus Problem solver implementation in the restricted assignment case.

In the restricted assignment case, each present j has a fixed value pj for all kids
who can receive it, and 0 for kids who cannot receive it.

Tests cover both simple and complex cases, including:
1. Basic allocation with restricted assignment valuations
2. Complex restricted assignment cases with overlapping preferences
3. Edge cases with different capacities
